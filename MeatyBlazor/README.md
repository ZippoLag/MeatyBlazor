# MeatyBlazor - Demo I - "mise en place"

Welcome to the repository for the "Blazor: Straight to the meat" webinar!

The purpose of this repo is merely giving an overview of a few core features of Blazor and how to avoid a few common pitfalls that you may find as you begin your journey with this framework.

## Changelog
