# MeatyBlazor - Demo I - "mise en place"

Welcome to the repository for the "Blazor: Straight to the meat" webinar!

The purpose of this repo is merely giving an overview of a few core features of Blazor and how to avoid a few common pitfalls that you may find as you begin your journey with this framework.

This document will try and provide an outline (recipe?!) of what we'll be adding on the next commit, and a brief changelog of what was added on the previous.

## Changelog
- Wipeout "hello world" and turn it into a boilerplate project


## Next steps
